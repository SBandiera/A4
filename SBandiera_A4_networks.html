      <p>
        At Network Answer in Melbourne, I worked as part of a team delivering end to end network solutions for small to medium businesses, primarily in the medical
        and professional services sectors. My role involved designing and implementing secure LAN and WAN configurations, setting up wireless access points, 
        managing routers and switches, and ensuring reliable connectivity between remote sites and main offices. This hands-on experience has prepared me well for
        the challenges of maintaining stable communications in demanding and remote environments such as those commonly found in mining operations.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the core skills I developed was the ability to assess a clientâ€™s requirements and translate them into a tailored infrastructure solution.
        For example, I often worked with practices that required strict uptime and data availability for their patient records. Designing networks with redundancy,
        backup connectivity, and automatic failover became second nature. These same principles are essential in the mining industry where continuous access to 
        operational data and control systems is critical to maintaining productivity and safety.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Security was a major focus in all of our projects. I was responsible for configuring firewalls, setting up secure remote access using VPNs, and implementing 
        endpoint protection systems. The same threats that target medical data apply to the intellectual property and operational technologies used in mining.
        My background ensures I can proactively design and manage systems that protect against data loss, breaches, and unauthorized access across distributed sites.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I also gained experience working with cloud integration and hybrid environments. Many of our clients relied on Microsoft 365 and Azure for email, 
        document sharing, and offsite backups. I routinely handled migrations, user provisioning, and performance optimization. In a mining context, this experience 
        is directly transferable to supporting cloud based resource management tools, remote collaboration between sites, and scalable backup solutions for 
        operational data.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Perhaps most importantly, I understand how to operate in environments where IT is not the focus of the business but is nonetheless mission critical.
        I became skilled at supporting users with varying levels of technical knowledge, translating complex IT processes into clear outcomes, and ensuring 
        systems align with business needs. In mining, where engineers, geologists, and operations managers rely on dependable technology to do their jobs safely
        and efficiently, that ability to bridge IT with operations is key. I am confident that my experience at Network Answer has prepared me to bring valuable
        skills to the mining sector.
