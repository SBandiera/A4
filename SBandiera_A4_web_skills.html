    <section id="cybersecurity">
      <p>
        At Microbite Websites in Melbourne, I worked as a web developer focused on building fast, secure, and responsive websites for small business clients. 
        The nature of our work demanded not only technical expertise but also a strong understanding of how to create functional tools that delivered value 
        in real business contexts. Many of the sites I built supported essential services such as appointment scheduling, secure communication, 
        and real-time updates. These experiences taught me how to develop reliable systems that perform consistently- a skill that directly applies to
        the mining industry, where technology needs to work seamlessly under pressure and in remote conditions.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        One of my main responsibilities was optimizing websites for speed and accessibility, especially on mobile devices. I frequently built solutions that
        operated well in low bandwidth environments and made use of techniques like content caching and asynchronous data loading. This experience is highly 
        transferable to mining operations, where workers and field staff often access systems from remote locations with limited connectivity.
        My background ensures that I can build tools that work reliably even when network conditions are not ideal.
      </p>

      <p>
       Security was also a key priority in my role at Microbite. I implemented HTTPS, input validation, and secure user authentication on every project. 
       Many clients required custom portals with login systems that managed sensitive business data. These practices mirror the requirements of the mining sector,
       where operational data and proprietary information must be protected from external threats. My experience in enforcing strong security standards will support
       safe and compliant digital solutions in any mining environment.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Another aspect of my role involved integrating third party services and automating workflows for our clients. Whether it was connecting booking platforms, 
        processing form submissions, or automating emails and reports, I became highly skilled at building web-based systems that saved clients time and reduced errors. 
        These same skills can be used to create internal tools for mining operations-  such as maintenance tracking systems, equipment request forms, or safety incident logs-
        that improve efficiency and support real-time decision making.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Lastly, working at Microbite taught me how to communicate effectively with people who are not technical experts. I often translated client needs into clear
        technical solutions, worked through constraints, and delivered user-focused results. In mining, IT professionals need to work closely with engineers, supervisors,
        and field staff to deliver tools that actually help them get the job done. I am confident that my web development background and strong communication skills
        position me well to contribute meaningfully to a mining companyâ€™s digital infrastructure.
