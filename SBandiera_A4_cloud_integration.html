    <section id="cybersecurity">
      <p>
        During my time working on a hybrid cloud integration project for a large manufacturing company, I gained hands-on
        experience managing critical infrastructure across both on-premises and cloud environments. My primary role involved 
        deploying Microsoft Azure services to enhance operational uptime and data availability while maintaining secure 
        connectivity with legacy systems. The technical challenges of this project taught me how to design and maintain systems 
        that function reliably in environments where downtime is not an option—a mindset that directly applies to the mining 
        industry, where continuous operations are critical.
      </p>

      <p>
        One key aspect of the project was implementing secure, low-latency connectivity between remote facilities and the 
        central cloud infrastructure using site-to-site VPNs. In mining, where operations often occur in isolated locations 
        with limited internet reliability, the ability to build robust and secure remote access solutions is crucial. 
        I developed protocols for remote monitoring and file synchronization that ensured data consistency even in 
        low-bandwidth conditions. This experience translates well to supporting remote mining camps or autonomous 
        equipment monitoring systems.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Automation was another major component of the project. I used Azure DevOps and PowerShell scripting to standardize 
        deployments, enforce system policies, and reduce manual intervention. These practices not only reduced operational 
        errors but also increased efficiency—a priority in mining where IT personnel might need to manage systems across 
        vast and physically challenging environments. Automating tasks like user provisioning, patching, and monitoring 
        can directly support mining companies' goals to streamline IT support and improve safety.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Security and compliance were also at the forefront. Our systems handled sensitive design data and intellectual 
        property, so I developed and enforced strict access controls, auditing systems, and encrypted backups.
        Mining companies handle valuable proprietary data related to geology, operations, and logistics, and the need 
        to protect this information is paramount. My background gives me confidence in designing secure systems that 
        meet industry standards while supporting compliance with regulations.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Finally, I worked closely with both technical teams and non-technical stakeholders, translating complex IT solutions
        into practical outcomes that aligned with business needs. This ability to communicate clearly and collaborate across
        disciplines is essential in mining, where IT professionals must often coordinate with engineers, geologists, 
        and operations staff. I’m confident that my experience bridging IT with operational goals makes me well-prepared
        to support the evolving technological needs of a modern mining company.
